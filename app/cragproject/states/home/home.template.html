    </div>
    <p><strong>Rock Climb Canada</strong> is an ongoing side project of a few dedicated rock climbers from New Brunswick, Canada. The purpose of the site is to act as a central database of all rock climbs and climbing locations across Canada. To start, we are simply inputting data for provinces for which we have data readily available (and easily) available. As of now, that means New Brunswick! With enough interest (and eager volunteers to input data for their respective areas across the country), we'd like this site to rival the likes of <a href="http://rockclimbing.com/" title="Rock Climbing Dot Com">www.rockclimbing.com</a> and <a href="http://mountainproject.com/" title="Mountain Project Dot Com">www.mountainproject.com</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Why compete with already well-established databases?</strong> The team developing this site make websites &amp; web apps for a living. We know our stuff, and we know what makes a good user experience. And, inversely, we know what makes a bad user experience. Lengthy load times, incomplete/inconsistent data, confusing UI, page refreshes for every new page, lots of advertisements, lack of moderation, you name it... all of these are things we know we can, and have, improved on drastically. We think you'll agree after you use our site for just a few minutes :)</p>
    <p><strong>Where do I go first?</strong> That's entirely up to you. You don't need to register/login in order to simply browse around the site and see all of the climbs in the database -- but we'd love it if you'd contribute, so you should sign up! If you've already signed up, you can log in and continue being awesome.</p>
